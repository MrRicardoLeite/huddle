## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this challenge I basically used the CSS grid. I had some difficulty but I went after the knowledge and managed, in my own way, to finish the challenge.

### Continued development

I intend to better understand the grid and flex to fully integrate the acquired knowledge and be able to be efficient in frontend development. :)
